# QuoteGenerator
Created with CodeSandbox

This is a small project that returns a new quote every time you click on the button.

The quotes were manually inputted in a "quotes.js" file, and so far, only three quotes are available.

The whole point of the exercise was to create something that uses state and randomization.
